This directory defines an API endpoint using FastAPI that accepts POST requests to the route "/api/volume_prediction". The endpoint expects two input parameters, vol_moving_avg and adj_close_rolling_med, both of which are floats passed in as form data. The endpoint uses the input features to make a prediction of the trading volume using a pre-trained gradient boosting model loaded from a joblib file. The predicted volume is then returned in a JSON format as the response.
